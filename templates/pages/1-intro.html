  <p>Hello Basecamp Team!</p>
  <p>I'm Steve, a programmer and sports nerd, from Royal Oak, Michigan. 
    Should you be looking for someone to chat about the NBA salary cap, your favorite pitcher's xFIP, or are just looking for someone to play tennis against (the Mario variety or real life version), 
    do not hesitate to call the number at the top of my resume.</p>

  <p>I enjoy making things - software, humorous vector illustrations, hot sauces - you know, just your standard hobbies. Vector images available upon request.
    The static slide show generator used to create this website was a project I started after getting excited hearing the news that you were hiring a programmer on your
    Research &amp; Fidelity team. </p>
  <p>My hope was that this Javascript project would do a better job communicating my enthusiasm
    than the boring cover letter I sent for your previous job opening.</p>

  <p>Slide <a href="slide-show-generator.html">four</a> contains information on the slide show project, but before we get to those technical details, 
    let me tell you why I would be a great fit for the open position on your Research &amp; Fidelity team.</p>
